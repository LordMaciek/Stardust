Please select from the following options and confirm with the RETURN key:
1. Take the pictures
2. Crop and scale the pictures
3. Stack the picture by avarageing each pixel
4. Enhance the picture (COMING SOON!)
5. Run a wee local server, which will show you your creations!

TIP: In my opinion it's best to start with option number one. Otherwise the program will not work, too...
